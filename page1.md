Docker is an open source application container engine, based on the Go language and open source under the Apache2.0 protocol.

Docker allows developers to package their applications and dependencies into a lightweight, portable container, which can then be distributed to any popular Linux machine, and can also be virtualized.

The container completely uses the sandbox mechanism, and there will be no interface between each other (similar to iPhone apps), and more importantly, the performance overhead of the container is extremely low.
